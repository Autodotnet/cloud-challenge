Welcome to my Cloud Challenge Resume repo! 

This is a Cloud project where I have to build a web application. The application consists of a web page displaying my CV with a visitor counter. The project is still in a test stage, but the major steps have been completed.

Here, you can find the code for my application, including the front end and the backend (Lambda function), as well as the Terraform code to build the resources instead of using the console. Later, I will add the test to my API. 

This is the underlying infrastructure. enjoy!
