Welcome to my Cloud Challenge Resume repo! 

This is a Cloud project where I have to build a web application in AWS. The application contains a web page displaying my CV with a visitor counter that stores the visits in a database. The project is still in a test stage. So far, I have created the frontend and backend, linked both of them using a REST API, written tests to validate the API and created the IaC for the frontend.

This is the underlying infrastructure. enjoy!
